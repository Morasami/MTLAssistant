MTL Assistant is a simple python selenium script for using multiple Machine Translation Services at the same time

for the full script with all services use [MTLA.py](https://github.com/Morasami/MTLAssistant/blob/main/MTLA.py)

If you want to understand how it works easier there's [BaseMTLA.py](https://github.com/Morasami/MTLAssistant/blob/main/BaseMTLA.py) which has the basic structure for the selenium script, however it's slower and not as refined

if you want to use the tool online you can use it on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a_DkUNB6S7x_UYB7XbOFB7TpdQW8QK_y?usp=sharing) , but it only has 3 out of 5 services

Services Currently working:

Google Translate,
Bing,
Reverso,
Papago,
and Yandex

to use the script on your local machine all you need to have is selenium, to install selenium use

```
pip install selenium
```
